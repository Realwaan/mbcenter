                Our purpose is to help Scouts and Scouters achieve their Scouting

                the help of other people, creating and maintaining this website 
                would have been impossible. We dedicate an extremely small portion

                symbolize the point of the Scout Law of being <em>&quot;A Scout

                  High School Scouting Unit. Even before his involvement as a
                  professional in the BSP he has been an ardent supporter of
                  the use of the World-Wide-Web to benefit Scouting in the Philippines.
                  He was the driving force in reviving the Internet presence
                  of the BSP through an official website, which the BSP leadership
                  did not support, and in giving Filipino boys the opportunity
                  to join the Jamboree On The Internet. He continues on today
                  as a defacto ambassador of the Merit Badge Center, promoting
