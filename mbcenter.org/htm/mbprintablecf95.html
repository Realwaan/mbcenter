<h1>Citizenship</h1>

<ol type=1><p>

<li>Participate in a community service project for at least four (4) hours that addresses a local challenge(s) (e.g., clean-up drive, health campaign). Reflect on the social impact and personal growth you experienced.
  <p>

<li>Identify your core personal values and write an essay about how they guide your decisions and actions and how you can relate it to Scout Oath and Law.
  <p>

<li>Study the key provisions of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, focusing on the Bill of Rights and the structure of the government. Create a report or presentation highlighting its importance in protecting citizens' rights and ensuring democratic governance.
  <p>

<li>Do the following activities:
  <ol type=a>
<li>Identify key Filipino Values (i.e., bayanihan, pakikisama, hospitality). Reflect on how these values were perceived globally.
<li>Define and explain to your counselor the relationship of Scout Oath and Law to Identities, Diversity, Equity, Equality, Inclusion, Discrimination, and Ethical decisions.
<li>Dicuss with your counselor ideas on what you can personally do to create a safe and comfortable Scouting environment for all.
  </ol>
  <p>

<li>(See Requirement #4) - <strong>Note from the Merit Badge Center:</strong> The
updated <a href="../downloads/2025-Updated-Senior-Scout-Passport.pdf">Senior Scout Passport</a> shows the same set of activities for requirements 4 &amp; 5. Requirement 4 asks to do two activities while requirement 5 asks to do one activity. If so, I interpreted this to mean to complete all three activities.
<p>
<li>Participate in a spiritual retreat or reflection activity that aligns with your beliefs. Reflect and share with your crew about how spiritual groups/movements contribute to your overall well-being and how it contributes to our society.</ol>
