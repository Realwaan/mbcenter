<h1>Dramatics</h1>


<ol type=1><p>

<li>Show that you are familiar with the outstanding period in the history of drama, beginning with Greek drama and including Philippine drama.<p>

<li>Submit evidence that you have taken part in a play presented to an audience of at least fifty persons, such part to be of sufficient importance to give you the opportunity to display your dramatic ability.<p>

<li>Submit a one-act play written by yourself, of at least twenty (20) minutes duration - preferably on a subject connected with Scouting with a Philippine setting - with a sketch of the set for such play, indicating left and right of stage, back drop, proscenium, etc.<p>

<li>Through an oral quiz, using your own play in Requirement Number 3 to illustrate, show a knowledge of the fundamental elements of a play - like plot, characterization, and dialogue. Point out some of the elements of the plot - such as conflict, surprise, rising action, climax, etc. Show why the dialogue should be natural and brief, and accompanied by action.<p>

<li>Make yourself up as an old man.<p>

<li>Present to the Counselor a list of five entertainment features which you can give at a moment's notice - either alone or with others - suitable for campfires, Troop meetings, or general gatherings, and present any two selected by the Counselor from such list.</ol>
