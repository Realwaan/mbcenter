<h1>Surveying</h1>

<ol type=1><p>

<li>Do one of the following:
<ol type=a>
<li>From an initial point, measure by tape a range line north 100 meters, and south 100 meters. Using the same initial point and procedure, establish a baseline east 100 meters, and west 100 meters. Locate the main features of the area by compass readings and pace measurements from one or more stations along the range or base lines.
<li>Establish the corners of a lot describe as follows: from a point of beginning; thence running (1) north 16° 30' east, 17.8 meters, thence (2) north 77° east, 20.5 meters; thence (3) south 49° 30' east, 22.4 meters; thence (4) south 55° west, 30 meters; thence (5) north 60° west, 20 meters to the point of beginning. The error of closure must not exceed 1.5 meters. Locate the main features of the lot by compass readings and pace measurements from its corners.</ol><p>

<li>From the field notes gathered from Requirement Number 1, draw a map to convenient scale. Submit a neatly drawn copy of the map to your Counselor.<p>

<li>Sue the initial point or point of beginning as a bench mark with an assumed elevation of 30 meters to determine the elevation of four other points.<p>

<li>Without traversing a distance of approximately 100 to 1,000 meters, determine its length by proper surveying methods, then tape the distance. Your figure must be within 5% of the taped measurement.<p>

<li>Determine the height of a point by accepted surveying methods that can be checked by raising or lowering a tape. Your figure must be within 5% of the taped measurement.<p>

<li>Discuss with your Counselor the development and importance of surveying.</ol>
